            Edukit Nigeria is an initiative aimed at transforming educational
            access for underprivileged students across Nigeria. We are dedicated
            to addressing the critial issues of educational inequality,
            particularly in rural and low-income urban areas where students
            often lack essential resources like textbooks, school supplies, and
            digital learning tools.
          </p>
          <p>
            Edukit Nigeria is committed to bridging the gap between those who
            have surplus educational materials and those WHO are eager to learn
            but cannot afford the necessary resources. We believe that education
            should be a right, not a privilege, and that every child deserves
            access to the tools that will empower them to build their dreams.

              resources. According to UNICEF, over 10 million children are out

              supplies,and digital tools. Despite the large amount of unused
              resources in householda of those who have completed their
              schooling or advanced to higher levels(e.g. from secondary to
              university), there is no efficient system to redistribute those
              materials to those in need. Reliance on donations alone
              insufficient to meet the demand contributing to persistent
              education inequality.
